# Create T3 App

 This is a project that I have begun working on to start learning Next.js, React, and PostgreSQL. I also used this to learn how to connect to Clerk for authentication, Vercel for CI/CD, and Sentry for error management. I am still currently working on this project and have a todo list below that have the features implemented and the features I am going to add in the future. As I am submitting this project, I am  working on implementing parallel routes so that images can be loaded into a modal but also accessible through their own page. 

## TODO

- [*] Make it deploy
- [*] Scaffold basic UI with mock data
- [*] Tidy up build process
- [*] Actually set up a database
- [*] Attach database to UI
- [*] Add Authentication (w/ clerk)
- [*] Add image upload
- [*] Fix server taint
- [*] Use Next/Image components
- [*] Error Management(w/ Sentry)
- [ ] Routing/image page (parallel route)
- [ ] Delete Button (w/ server actions)
- [ ] analytics (posthog)
- [ ] ratelimiting (upstash)

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
